# Lab

## Getting Setup (I will guide you through this)

Go to https://github.com/HypertheoryTraining/applied-angular-lab-dec-19-2024

Click the "fork" button.

Hit the "Create Fork" button.

This will create a fork (copy) of the lab in your Github account.

After the fork is created, click the [<> Code] button, make sure the "Github CLI" tab is selected, and copy the command that is displayed.

On your VM, open the [>_] Windows Terminal. You should be in the class folder.

Past the command you copied above into your terminal and run it.

Example:

```sh
gh repo clone YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/applied-angular-lab-dec-19-2024-trial
```

Type the following in the terminal:

```sh
cd applied-angular-lab-dec-19-2024-trial
npm ci && code
```

Get ready to rock.

Do the lab(s). Commit your code and push it as often as you like.

When you are _done_, push your final changes to the Github, open your repo in the browser on github, and send a pull request.

Hit the "contribute" button, make a pull request, giving me a brief note about what you did.

## Options

You have several options for this lab time.

## Counter [Counter Lab Instructions](./counter.md)

Do the counter again.
I changed the lab so that you can do it again as a "feature", using feature flags.

## Books [Books Lab](./books.md)

This one is a little more involved.

## Learning Resource Center [LRC Lab](./posts.md)

You could continue on with what we started in the LRC.
