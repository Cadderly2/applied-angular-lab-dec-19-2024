You could decide to keep working on the Learning Resource Center.

Here are the notes from the design meeting that went on between Jeff and his imaginary friend:

# Learning Resource Center

We want an application that allows our developers to share helpful resources with one another.

These posts could be:

- A link to a helpful site, document, guide
- A link to a video (tutorial, lecture, etc.)
- A link to a video series about a particular topic.
- A link to information about an online training course.
- A link to information about a classroom training course.

Each post should display a short name, a longer description, and a link to the resource.

- If the link is a video, it should embed the video in the list.
- If it is a video series, it should embed the first video, with links for each subsequent video.
- If the link is to an online course, the price for that course (if any) should be included.
- If the link is to a classroom training course, the price, and number of days should be provided.

Employees should be able to see a list of all the resources that have been posted.

They should be able to filter by:

- Author
- Type (link, video, etc.)

They should be able to sort the list by name, or by date posted.

Any developer should be able to 'flag' a post for review, with a comment - if the link is out of date, has bad data, etc.

Only the original creator of the post can edit or remove the link.
